This is a beginner-friendly backend project where I built a User API using Golang, Gin, and GORM with MySQL.
The project covers:

Database connection with MySQL

Creating a REST API with Gin

User model with fields: Name, Email, Password

API endpoints for creating and fetching users

This project is a big step in my backend learning journey, and Iâ€™ll soon be adding password hashing, JWT authentication, and later integrating Machine Learning models.
